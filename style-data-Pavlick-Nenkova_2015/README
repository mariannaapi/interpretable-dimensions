This data release contains automatically induced style scores as well as human 
style ratings for words and phrases along two style dimensions: formality
and complexity. The data is organized in the following directory structure:

The contents of each file are described below. The formality and complexity directories
are exactly parallel, but both are described in full, just to be excessively verbose. :-)

**formality/automatic/phrase-scores
List of words and phrases scored using the log-ratio method described in the paper. 
The file contains the 4 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the normalized log-ratio score. 1.0 is most formal, 0.0 is most casual
-column 2: the phrase
-column 3: total number of occurances of the phrase in the combined formal+casual corpora (Europarl+Switchboard)
-column 4: total number of occurances of the phrase in the formal corpus (Europarl)
Phrases which occured fewer than 20 times in the combined corpora were removed. 
See "Notes and Disclaimers" below for more information.

**formality/automatic/pairs
List of scored paraphrase pairs from the paraphrase database (PPDB-XL) (see paraphrase.org). 
The file contains the 3 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the absolute value of the difference between the formality scores of the two phrases,
   you can view a larger number here as a higher confidence in the difference.  
-column 2: the more casual of the two phrases
-column 3: the more formal of the two phrases

**formality/human/phrase-scores
List of words and phrases rated by annotators on MTurk.
The file contains the 3 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the mean of the 7 human scores on a scale from 1 to 100: 100 is most formal, 0 is most casual.
-column 2: the phrase
-column 3: the standard deviation of the human scores; you can view a smaller number here as a higher 
   confidence in the difference.  

**formality/human/pairs
List of paraphrase pairs from PPDB rated by annotators on MTurk.
The file contains the 4 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the proportion of raters (out of 7) agreeing on the majority decision.
   you can view a larger number here as a higher confidence in the difference.  
-column 2: the more casual of the two phrases, as chosen by the majority of workers
-column 3: the more formal of the two phrases, as chosen by the majority of workers
-column 4: 'NA' if the majority opinion was that there is no difference  between the two phrases,
   otherwise empty. Note that if this column is 'NA', then the order of columns 2 and 3 is irrelevant

**formality/human/sentence-scores
List of sentences rated by annotators on MTurk.
The file contains the 4 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the mean of the 7 human scores on a scale from 1 to 100: 100 is most formal, 0 is most casual.
-column 2: the genre from which the sentence was taken (from the MASC corpus)
-column 3: the sentence
-column 4: the standard deviation of the human scores; you can view a smaller number here as a higher 
   confidence in the difference.

**complexity/automatic/phrase-scores
List of words and phrases scored using the log-ratio method described in the paper. 
The file contains the 4 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the normalized log-ratio score. 1.0 is most complex, 0.0 is most simple
-column 2: the phrase
-column 3: total number of occurances of the phrase in the combined complex+simple corpora (Wiki+SimpleWiki)
-column 4: total number of occurances of the phrase in the complex corpus (Wiki)
Phrases which occured fewer than 20 times in the combined corpora were removed. 
See "Notes and Disclaimers" below for more information.

**complexity/automatic/pairs
List of scored paraphrase pairs from the paraphrase database (PPDB-XL) (see paraphrase.org). 
The file contains the 3 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the absolute value of the difference between the complexity scores of the two phrases,
   you can view a larger number here as a higher confidence in the difference.  
-column 2: the more simple of the two phrases
-column 3: the more complex of the two phrases

**complexity/human/phrase-scores
List of words and phrases rated by annotators on MTurk.
The file contains the 3 columns, as follows:
-column 1: the mean of the 7 human scores on a scale from 1 to 100: 100 is most complex, 0 is most simple.
-column 2: the phrase
-column 3: the standard deviation of the human scores; you can view a smaller number here as a higher 
   confidence in the difference.

   confidence in the difference.

Some notes and disclaimers

**In general, we have found that the actual value given by the log-ratio score is not as informative 
as the ordering in produces. Bear that in mind if you are using the scores themselves in your own
work e.g. as features in a model.

**For the log-ratio phrase scores, we elected not to require that a phrase appear in both corpora 
in order to give it a score. Note that this adds some noise to the list by giving high scores to 
many topic words which may or may not be characteristic of the style. A simple way of cleaning the list 
is to exclude phrases which did not appear at least once in each corpus. This provides a slightly nicer
looking list, although (especially on the formality dimension) eliminates many interesting examples.  

**For the MTurk ratings, most cases were rated by 7 labelers. A few pairs were accidentally posted twice,
so were rated by 14 Turkers.
