Style data from the Data with high annotation confidence from the Pavlick and Nenkova (2015) datasets (1,160 words for complexity, 1,274 words for formality). 
The filtering is described in Section 3.3 of our paper. 

Each file contains 3 columns:

column 1: the mean of the 7 human scores on a scale from 1 to 100: 100 is most formal, 0 is most casual.
column 2: the phrase
column 3: the standard deviation of the human scores. A smaller number can be viewed as a higher confidence in the difference.
